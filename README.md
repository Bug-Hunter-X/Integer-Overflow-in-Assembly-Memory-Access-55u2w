This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in assembly programming: integer overflow during memory address calculation. The `bug.asm` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.asm` provides a corrected version. The potential for integer overflow is highlighted, along with an explanation of how it can cause unexpected behavior and lead to hard-to-find bugs. This is a crucial concept to understand when working with low-level programming and memory management.
