To prevent integer overflow, we need to check the intermediate results before using them in the memory access calculation.  We can implement a check to ensure that each calculation does not exceed the maximum representable value.

```assembly
; Check for overflow before calculating the address
mov eax, ecx
mov ebx, 4
mull ebx ; Multiply ecx and 4, store result in edx:eax
jg overflow_error ; Jump if overflow occurred
add eax, [ebx]
add eax, 0x10
jg overflow_error ; Jump if overflow occurred
mov [eax], someValue
jmp end_of_function

overflow_error:
; Handle the overflow error (e.g., report an error and exit)
end_of_function:
```

This revised code first performs the multiplication, then checks for overflow using the carry flag.  A jump to `overflow_error` handles the error appropriately.  Similar checks should be added before the addition operations as well.
